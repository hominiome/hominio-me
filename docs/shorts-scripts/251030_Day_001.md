## VOICEOVER SCRIPT (Clean - For Recording)

### ACT 1: The Question

For 15 years, this one question kept me awake for so many nights.

Our human potential is so utterly mindblowing.

Yet, we waste trillions of hours just to survive.

Is this really the world we want to live in?

Is this really the legacy we want to leave to our children?

**[SCENE CHANGE + MOOD SHIFT - Hood down reveal]**

I say NO, and deep in my heart, I believe you say no too.

So here is the question? 

What would it take, to unleash the full potential in each one of us?

**[SCENE CHANGE + MOOD SHIFT - Walking energy]**

### ACT 2: The Coin's Journey

Let's find out.

**[MONTAGE - No voiceover]**

**[SCENE CHANGE + MOOD SHIFT - Office intimacy]**

This coin here, has been everywhere. A thousand hands, a thousand stories.

But what if it became part of something bigger? What if it was one of a million?

A million humans placing each, just €1 into one collective fund. One million euros strong.

Just imagine what we could build with this collective power.

**[SCENE CHANGE + MOOD SHIFT - Rising vision]**

I see us launching a new breed of startups, where we wake up with sparkling eyes and fire in the belly every day.

I see us funding visionary founders who turn waste into wealth, who turn monoculture into food forests, who prove that purpose, profit and planet were always meant to thrive together.

**[SCENE CHANGE + MOOD SHIFT - Explanation mode]**

### ACT 3: The Mechanism

And here is how.

Enter the Hominio Summit. 

Think of it like the Champions League, but for purpose-driven startups.

128 founders compete in 1vs1 pitching rounds, while the community votes with just €1 each, who receives 1 million seed investment.

But here is the twist: How fast we get there entirely depends on you and the founders competing.

Only when we are a million strong and we sold 10,000 tickets to the grand finale in September 2026, we select the final winner. 

And then we repeat, year after year, each time bolder and bigger until 1 billion humans unite - upgrading civilization at a scale never seen before. 

**[SCENE CHANGE + MOOD SHIFT - Placing the coin]**

### ACT 4: Day 1 Commitment

I can't wait to see, what we will create. 

So, let's better get to work.

This is Day 01 and this is Euro No. 1.

Today it's just one euro. Tomorrow we will see.

But what I know deep in my heart for sure is this:

In September 2026, this will be a 1 million strong tower.

**[SCENE CHANGE + MOOD SHIFT - Direct CTA]**

### CTA: Round 1

Round 1 - starting today - and now, it's your turn.

Tag 3 people who need to see this, and then share it 100 times and I'll drop the next episode on this journey.
