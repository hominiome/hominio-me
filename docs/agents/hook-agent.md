## ⚡ THE GOLDEN RULE

**EVERY HOOK MUST BE 9-16 WORDS MAXIMUM. COUNT THEM.**

If it's longer, it's not a hook—it's a paragraph. Cut ruthlessly.

---

## THE TWO HOOK FRAMEWORKS

### FRAMEWORK 1: The 6 Power Words (Building Blocks)

Every great hook uses these 6 components. The first 4 are REQUIRED. The last 2 are OPTIONAL.

#### THE 4 CORE POWER WORDS (Always Required)

**1. SUBJECT CLARITY WORD**
- Who is taking action?
- Options: I, we, you, they, [specific entity]
- Must be crystal clear who/what the hook is about

*Examples:*
- "I" → "If I had to grow from zero to 100K subs..."
- "You" → "If you've struggled with acne your whole life..."
- "This €1 coin" → "This €1 coin will become a million-euro tower..."
- "1 million humans" → "1 million humans deciding together..."

**2. ACTION WORD**
- What transformation is happening?
- Use active verbs (not passive)
- Show movement from A → B

*Examples:*
- "grow," "build," "transform," "decide," "place," "unleash"
- "If I had to GROW from zero..." (action word)
- "Your €1 DECIDES which founder..." (action word)

**3. OBJECTIVE/END-STATE WORD** ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
- What's the final result?
- **MUST be SHOCKING and NON-OBVIOUS**
- The more unexpected, the better
- This is where curiosity lives

*Examples:*
- "€1 million tower" (shocking visual transformation)
- "before you build it" (unexpected time shift)
- "13-year-olds" (shocking contrast to "smarter")

**BAD Objectives (too obvious):**
- "get more followers" (predictable)
- "make money" (expected)
- "be successful" (vague)

**GOOD Objectives (shocking):**
- "€1 becomes €1M fund" (extreme contrast)
- "walk through your home before you build it" (impossible made possible)
- "wash your bread before eating" (wtf moment)

**4. CONTRAST WORD**
- Compares base state vs. new reality
- Creates tension through distance
- The bigger the gap, the stronger the hook

*How it works:*
- Base state = what viewer believes now
- New reality = what you're offering
- Distance = curiosity gap

*Examples:*
- "0 to 100K" (zero vs 100,000 = huge contrast)
- "€1 vs €1M" (1 vs 1,000,000 = shocking contrast)
- "before you build it" (after vs before = time reversal)
- "older/wiser" vs "13-year-olds" (age reversal = unexpected)

#### THE 2 OPTIONAL POWER WORDS

**5. PROOF WORD** (Optional but powerful for education content)
- Why should they trust you?
- Establishes credibility
- More important for education than entertainment

*Examples:*
- "again" → "If I had to grow from 0 to 100K again..." (implies you've done it before)
- "I've done this 15 times" → Shows expertise
- "After 10 years..." → Time-based proof
- Showing your results → Visual proof

**6. TIME WORD** (Optional but creates urgency)
- Adds time constraint or speed element
- Maps urgency to effectiveness
- Increases perceived value

*Examples:*
- "in 48 hours"
- "by September 2026"
- "right now today"
- "in 5 months"
- "before you..."

### FRAMEWORK 2: The 4 Hook Mistakes (What Kills Hooks)

If your hook isn't working, you're making ONE of these four mistakes. Fix them in this order:

#### MISTAKE 1: DELAY
**Problem:** You're taking too long to get to the point.

**The Issue:**
- Context comes too late (line 3+ instead of line 1)
- Vague opening ("This is crazy!" → What is?)
- Building suspense without clarity
- Every second without context = viewers bouncing

**The Fix: SPEED TO VALUE**
- Introduce topic in first 1-2 seconds
- Cut ALL fluff before the main point
- Move your third line to line one

*Bad (Delay):*
"Guys, this is one of the craziest things I've ever seen. When you see it, you're never going to believe it."
→ Problem: Zero context. Could be ANYTHING. Viewers leave.

*Good (No Delay):*
"Here are three simple ways to improve your gut health."
→ Topic clear immediately. Viewers can decide to opt in.

**Rule:** First sentence = topic clarity. No exceptions.

---

#### MISTAKE 2: CONFUSION
**Problem:** Your words/phrasing are unclear.

**The Issue:**
- Comprehension loss (viewer only understands 50% of words)
- Complex sentence structure
- Passive voice instead of active
- Too many ideas crammed together
- Viewer can't assess if video is for them

**The Fix: CRYSTAL CLARITY**
- Use 6th grade reading level
- Active voice, not passive ("dog jumped" not "jump of the dog")
- Fewer words, simpler phrasing
- Only ONE idea per sentence

*Bad (Confusion):*
"These guys built a $30 million empire and the online money they made is most difficult to earn if you don't develop a journaling practice like they did."
→ Too complex. Hard to parse. What's the point?

*Good (Clear):*
"These guys built a $30 million empire and their secret was their insane journaling practice."
→ Same idea, way clearer. Subject → action → result.

**Clarity Tactics:**
1. **Use ChatGPT/Claude prompt:** "Rewrite this at 6th grade reading level without changing meaning: [your hook]"
2. **Ask yourself:** "Can this be misunderstood in multiple ways?" If yes, rewrite.
3. **Read out loud:** If you stumble, viewer will too.

---

#### MISTAKE 3: IRRELEVANCE
**Problem:** Viewer doesn't think this is FOR THEM.

**The Issue:**
- Using "I/me" instead of "you/your"
- No clear pain point addressed
- Viewer thinks: "That's cool for THEM, but not for ME"
- Not targeted enough

**The Fix: DIRECT ADDRESS + PAIN AGITATION**

**Tactic 1: Use "YOU" and "YOUR"**

*Bad (Irrelevant):*
"I've struggled with skin problems my whole life."
→ Viewer thinks: "That's YOUR problem, not mine."

*Good (Relevant):*
"If YOU've struggled with skin problems YOUR whole life..."
→ Viewer thinks: "Oh, this IS for me."

**Tactic 2: Frame Around Expected Value**

Two types of value:
- **Entertainment** = solve boredom
- **Education** = solve specific problem

Agitate a known pain point they already have.

*Bad:*
"These are three common trends in skincare."
→ Nice to have (not urgent)

*Good:*
"If you struggle with acne, try these three things."
→ Need to have (pain point = relevance)

**Rule:** If viewer doesn't see themselves in first 3 seconds, they leave.

---

#### MISTAKE 4: DISINTEREST (The Curiosity Problem)
**Problem:** Topic is clear, relevant, but doesn't GRAB them.

**The Issue:**
- No curiosity loop opened
- No tension created
- Viewer thinks: "Meh, I'll watch later" (they won't)

**The Fix: BUILD CURIOSITY THROUGH CONTRAST**

**What is a Curiosity Loop?**
Viewer sees something → asks question in their mind → gets partial context → NEW question opens → more context → NEW question... repeating throughout video.

**Your job in the hook:** Open that FIRST curiosity loop.

**How to Create Curiosity: SET UP CONTRAST/COMPARISON**

Show A (what they know) vs B (your alternative):
- A = current common belief/solution
- B = contrarian/shocking alternative you're offering
- Distance between A & B = curiosity

*Example:*
"This one trick will clear up all your acne in 45 minutes without any side effects."

**Contrast happening:**
- A (base state) = 6 months of Accutane with side effects
- B (new reality) = 45 minutes, zero side effects
- Distance = "WTF, how?!" = curiosity

**Two Types of Contrast:**

**1. STATED CONTRAST (Explicit)**
You say BOTH A and B out loud.

*Example:*
"Most people solve their acne with Accutane, but I have an herbal remedy that does it three times faster."
→ Accutane vs herbal remedy (stated clearly)

**2. IMPLIED CONTRAST (Subtle)**
You only say B (your alternative), and A is implied/understood.

*Example:*
"If you want to solve your acne, this herbal supplement is eight times more effective."
→ Implied: More effective than what? (The common solutions everyone knows)

**Hook Structure with Curiosity:**
- **Line 1:** Topic clarity (gives context)
- **Lines 2-3:** Set up contrast (creates curiosity)

*Example:*
"The Vegas sphere has the biggest screen ever built. [CLARITY] But here's the thing—the screen is the LEAST impressive part. [CONTRAST] The audio is going to blow your mind. [BIGGER CURIOSITY]"

## HOOK EXAMPLES ANALYZED

### Example 1: Life-Size Floor Plans (15M views)
**Hook:** "These are called life-size floor plans. You can literally walk through your exact home design before you build it."

**Analysis:**
- **Subject:** You (implied) / life-size floor plans
- **Action:** walk through
- **Objective:** see home design before you build
- **Contrast:** "before you build" (base state = after you build, new = before)
- **Proof:** None (entertainment, doesn't need it)
- **Time:** "before" (time shift)
- **Delay:** None (topic clear immediately)
- **Confusion:** None (crystal clear)
- **Relevance:** "You" + "your home" (direct address)
- **Curiosity:** Contrast creates it (how can you see it BEFORE building?)

---

### Example 2: Wash Your Bread (66M views)
**Hook:** "This is why you should always wash your bread before eating it."

**Analysis:**
- **Subject:** You
- **Action:** wash your bread
- **Objective:** washed bread (implied)
- **Contrast:** "wash" (base = you don't wash bread, new = you do)
- **Delay:** None (topic immediate)
- **Confusion:** None (simple, clear)
- **Relevance:** "you should" (direct address)
- **Curiosity:** HUGE (wash BREAD?! WTF?)

---

### Example 3: Hormozi Relationship (6.3M views)
**Hook:** "If you find a girl who believes in your dreams more than you do, who makes you want to be a better man, who's willing to work alongside you to get there, and is grateful for whatever you have right now today, no matter where you're at, just marry her."

**Analysis:**
- **Subject:** You (men specifically)
- **Action:** find a girl + marry her
- **Objective:** List of qualities
- **Contrast:** "believes in your dreams MORE than you do" (you vs her belief)
- **Time:** "right now today"
- **Relevance:** "you" (direct, targeted at men)
- **Curiosity:** Built through list (what kind of girl? keep listening...)

---

### Example 4: 13-Year-Olds (2.9M views)
**Hook:** "If we were smarter, we would listen to 13-year-olds more."

**Analysis:**
- **Subject:** We
- **Action:** listen
- **Objective:** 13-year-olds (shocking!)
- **Contrast:** "smarter" → expect wise elders, get "13-year-olds" (shocking reversal)
- **Delay:** None
- **Confusion:** None (simple)
- **Relevance:** "we" (collective, royal we)
- **Curiosity:** HUGE (why 13-year-olds?!)

---

## HOMINIO-SPECIFIC HOOK EXAMPLES

---

## ADVANCED HOOK TACTICS

### TACTIC 1: VISUAL HOOKS (100x More Powerful Than Spoken)
- Put 3-5 words on screen in BIG, BOLD font
- Must work in autoplay (no sound)
- Creates motion + proof

*Examples:*
- "€1 → €1M"
- "48 hours left"
- "1 million decide"

---

### TACTIC 2: LEAD WITH BENEFITS OR PAIN
Transform feature hooks into benefit hooks.

*Bad:* "You should take magnesium because it's a mineral."
→ Feature (what it is)

*Good:* "If you want better sleep, you need magnesium."
→ Benefit (what it does for you)

---

### TACTIC 3: CULT HOPPING (Use Known References)
Wrap unknown concepts in known ones.

*Examples:*
- "Tinder for purpose-driven startups"
- "Champions League, but for purpose-driven founders"
- "Like Kickstarter proved crowdfunding works..."

---

### TACTIC 4: STACCATO SENTENCES
Short. Punchy. Clear.

*Bad:* "I'm going to tell you about how we're growing from 8 to 13 in the next 48 hours."

*Good:* "Eight Hominios. Forty-eight hours. Thirteen is the target."

---

### TACTIC 5: THE CURIOSITY LOOP STRUCTURE (3-Part Hook)

**Part 1: CONTEXT LEAN** (1-2 sentences)
- Give topic clarity
- Create common ground
- Open initial curiosity

**Part 2: SCROLL STOP** (1 sentence)
- Use contrasting word: "But," "However," "Yet," "Here's the thing"
- Brief relief (they feel satisfied for 1 second)
- They hit a window, can't look away

**Part 3: CONTRARIAN SNAPBACK** (1-2 sentences)
- Go OPPOSITE direction
- Open BIGGER curiosity gap
- They MUST stay to resolve

*Example (Vegas Sphere):*
- Context Lean: "The Vegas sphere has the biggest screen ever built." [CURIOSITY: How big?]
- Scroll Stop: "But here's the thing—" [BRIEF RELIEF: about to learn]
- Snapback: "The screen is the LEAST impressive part. The audio is going to blow your mind." [BIGGER CURIOSITY: WTF?!]

## HOOK WRITING WORKFLOW

### STEP 1: Write 5-10 Hook Options
Don't settle on one immediately. Generate options.

### STEP 2: Run Each Through Checklist
Eliminate weak ones. Identify top 3.

### STEP 3: Test With "Would I Stop?" Question
Be brutally honest. If no, keep iterating.

### STEP 4: Simplify Further
Can you cut ANY words without losing meaning? Do it.

### STEP 5: Design Visual Hook
What 3-5 words go on screen?

---

## COMMON HOOK PITFALLS (Avoid These)

### ❌ TOO VAGUE
*Bad:* "This changed everything for me."
→ What changed? Too vague.

*Good:* "This €1 coin became a €1 million fund in 48 hours."
→ Specific, shocking, clear.

### ❌ TOO LONG
*Bad:* "I want to tell you about how I discovered this amazing thing that completely transformed the way I think about building communities and movements from the ground up."
→ Way too long. Lose them after 5 words.

*Good:* "Eight strangers became a movement in 48 hours. Here's how."
→ 10 words. Punchy. Clear.

### ❌ BURYING THE LEAD
*Bad:* "So I was walking down the street yesterday thinking about life and then I saw this thing that made me realize..."
→ Get to the point!

*Good:* "This €1 coin is worth more than $1 million. Watch."
→ Lead with the shocking claim.

### ❌ NO CONTRAST
*Bad:* "I'm building a community of purpose-driven people."
→ So what? No tension.

*Good:* "Most communities have followers. Ours has co-owners with voting power."
→ Followers vs co-owners = contrast = curiosity.

---

## FINAL REMINDER: THE NON-NEGOTIABLES

1. **9-16 words. COUNT THEM.** If longer, it's not a hook.
2. **Objective must be SHOCKING.** If it's obvious, rewrite.
3. **Contrast creates curiosity.** No contrast = no hook.
4. **Fix the 4 mistakes:** Delay, Confusion, Irrelevance, Disinterest
5. **Use "you/your" for relevance.** Make it about THEM.
6. **Visual hook is 100x more powerful.** Don't skip it.

---
